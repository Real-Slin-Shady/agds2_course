Applications cover a wide diversity of data science methods and serve to demonstrate fundamental concepts and implementations, including mechanistic modelling, unsupervised classification, and supervised machine learning. The course combines a theoretical and a hands-on component and consists of a mixture of lectures, exercises, and a (small) self-guided project.\nSee Course Plan for a complete overview and contextualisation of the different applications."

In contrast to what the cloud computing revolution promised, many ideas start out from site or localized studies. The focus of these few chapters from the Handful of Pixels book is deliberate. I will show you through both examples in vegetation seasonality (phenology) and land-use and land-cover mapping (Block 4) that you can experiment with geo-spatial data on limited compute infrastructure. Furthermore, it also shows you that true science can be done with relatively modest means. You will learn to do big science with small data.\n\nSession 5 - 19.10.\n\nIntroduction to phenology modelling\nSelf-study of tutorial and exercises\n\n\n\nSession 6 - 26.10.\n\nSelf-study of tutorial and exercises"

This tutorial gives an introductive workflow for using Random Forests to predict soil properties across a study area in Bern. The tutorial demonstrates how advances in data availability (continuous maps of climate, terrain, etc.) can be used to predict soil properties that are usually laborious to obtain (e.g., pH, water logging, etc.). The self-guided continuation of the tutorial includes conducting variable selection, model building, model interpretation, and model testing.\n\nSession 7 - 02.11.\n\nIntroduction to digital soil mapping\nSelf-study of tutorial and exercises\n\n\n\nSession 8 - 09.11.\n\nSelf-study of tutorial and exercises"
